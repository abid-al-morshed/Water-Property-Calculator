# Water-Property-Calculator
The app is based on <i>Cengel and Cimbala, Fluid Mechanics: Fundamentals and Applications, Ed. 3, McGraw-Hill, 2014</i>. (Windows might consider it as virus which is a common issue with this type of file, but I assure you it is not a virus)
## How to use:
1. Download the exe file
2. Double click to launch
3. Enter the temperature value in celcius

This is the first trial version of the app. If you find any mismatch or unusual data please give me message. I welcome any feedback.

Thank you.
